# WeSpend: An Accountable Approach To Group Expenses

WeSpend is a first of its kind private social-network designed with an intention to make common expenses more accountable and trackable amongst the closed groups like family, hostel room-mates, office-team etc.

## Inspiration
* Many of our expenses happen in form of group expenses (family, hostel roomies, office-team etc.)
* However, most of these expenses are done by an individual with no form of immediate accountability

## Outcomes
* Group funds and expenses tracking becomes transparent, and trackable
* The application helps capture the emotional quotient of the expenses made by individuals, and can help in studying the reaction trends, and predict emotional outcome
* Dashboarding of relevant data-points to analyze historical expense data, and predict future expense trends
